# podcast-performance/players
Podcast-Performance/players is our open source code that allows anyone to host their own `<podcast:performance>` server and get key metrics of their episode data.

# Demo of idea
You can view the source code for a javascript web based player here - https://codepen.io/redimongo/full/BaeQyaP 

# Players Code
We will publish a number of different players over the next few months. Please if you want to contribute we welcome you too.

# Ideas

These are some ideas that people have suggested which technically could be added to podcast performance API.

- Forward on RemoteItem player data (this can be done server to server side so only 1 request would be needed).
- Allow a open comment system for episodes - stored on the podcasters Podcast Performance server. (some would call this an event and may use the <podcast:events> tag as part of that method).

# Got an Idea?

This code is open-sourced, we would love nothing more than people adding to this project.

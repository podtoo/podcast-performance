### Encrypted Messages

Podcast Performance will use the following method to generate a public key for each of its users:

## Overview

Podcast Performance utilizes RSA encryption to ensure secure communication and data protection for its users. Each user is assigned a unique pair of public and private keys. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept confidential.

## Key Generation

The public and private keys are generated using the `crypto` module in Node.js. The following parameters are used for key generation:

- **modulusLength**: 2048 bits - This defines the length of the key. A length of 2048 bits is considered secure for most applications.
- **publicKeyEncoding**: Specifies the encoding format for the public key. We use `spki` type and `pem` format.
- **privateKeyEncoding**: Specifies the encoding format for the private key. We use `pkcs8` type and `pem` format.

## Usage

1. **Key Storage**: Store the public key in the user's profile and the private key in a secure location, such as a secure vault or encrypted storage.

2. **Encryption**: Use the public key to encrypt messages or data before sending them to the user.

3. **Decryption**: The user can use their private key to decrypt the received messages or data.

Here is the revised version of your About.md with corrected spelling and grammar:

# About

We started this project to share with the community what we are doing at PodToo to provide podcasters with more analytics tools.

# Committed to Privacy 

We understand that privacy should always come first, and we need to give a shout-out to two people in the Podcasting 2.0 space who have helped shape this idea from a privacy-focused perspective.

- James Cridland - He pointed out that one of the main concerns is IP leakage, which occurs when your IP address is leaked and stored or used by someone without your permission. This comment got me thinking about how we could solve this issue.
- John Spurlock - He suggested that instead of using IP addresses, we should use server-to-server communication and set a session token. This suggestion allowed us to remove all IP addresses, even if they come from a client's player. We don't store them (This was part of version 1.0.1 and above).

# My Hope

I truly hope that the Podcast 2.0 community improves on this and even integrates it into OP3.dev, even if it's by adding op3.dev/ to the beginning of the URL. This was the one chart/graph missing from OP3 and, in many ways, from our community. I hope that somehow this gets supported and our community gains an important analytics tool that is open.

# podcast-performance/server
Podcast-Performance/server is our open source code that allows anyone to host their own `<podcast:performance>` server and get key metrics of their episode data.

# Demo of idea
You can view the source code for a javascript web based player here - https://codepen.io/redimongo/full/BaeQyaP 

# Demo of Server
Due to that this is designed to only support your episode GUID that you have in your database, we don't have an open demo server, we hope that this server code is easy to use and is straight forward in using. Please comment any issues.

# Server Code
Our server code will support the following technology
- MongoDB (atlas or local), MySQl, Firebase
- ExpressJS
- Docker

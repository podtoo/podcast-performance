# podcast-performance
Podcast-Performance is our open source code that allows anyone to host their own `<podcast:performance>` server and get key metrics of their episode data.

# Demo of idea
You can view the source code for a javascript web based player here - https://codepen.io/redimongo/full/BaeQyaP 
We will publish Swift code asap.

# Why is episode performance important?
Bots and other scripts can send a large number of download requests. While many podcast hosting companies, including PodToo, do their best to identify and disregard these numbers, some still slip through. Episode performance gathering however means we can verify that a user listened to the episode which means these bots become a thing of the past (unless they want to listen to the episode too), the Podcast Performance allows us to show podcast creators how much of an episode listeners are engaging too.

This insight enables podcast creators to determine if their episodes are too long or if certain parts, such as the first 30 seconds of intro music, are being skipped. Additionally, it provides valuable data on the engagement level of an episode, information that was previously unavailable to podcast creators.

# Why should I integrate this into my app?
Adding this feature demonstrates that your app cares about podcast creators and their listeners. Your app's total listener engagement time will be recorded, potentially making it the top app in terms of listener engagement. This could lead podcast creators to promote your app over others.

Platforms like Spotify are popular among podcasters because they offer features like Q&A and episode performance tracking. However, no single platform should dominate the market. By supporting an open standard that can be integrated into any Podcast 2.0 app, podcasters are more likely to support Podcast 2.0 over sticking exclusively with platforms like Spotify.

Also if you integrate we will put your logo on this page (just a small way of saying thank you).


# How do I integrate this into my podcast?
As part of our commitment to supporting the community, PodToo has made an open-source version of their podcast performance code. This allows you to host your own performance server. 

If you don't self-host, services like PodToo have already integrated this tag into their system, and you can access the stats in your dashboard. 

If you want to host your own performance server but use another provider, please ask them to support this tag. Keep a lookout here as I'll update this with all the providers and apps that support this.

# We are a hosting provider who supports this tag, can we get a plug?
Totally, just reach out to me via russell@podtoo.com and we would be happy to add your logo to this page.
